        <p class="intro">Hi, I'm Nikhil. I'm someone who's passionate about coding and always curious about how things
            work behind the
            scenesâ€”especially in the world of technology. I enjoy building projects, solving problems through code, and
            continuously learning new skills to improve myself. Whether it's developing something from scratch or
            experimenting with new tools, I find joy in creating and exploring through programming. In my free time,
            you'll
            usually find me coding, learning about tech trends, or working on small projects just for fun. I'm always
            excited to take on new challenges and grow as a developer.</p>
